# Redux Calculator: A Comprehensive React Practice Project

## Overview

This is a React project aimed at practicing fundamental concepts such as initial setup, functional components, state management with Redux, and user interactions. The application simulates a calculator where users can perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Learning Objectives:

- Implement React components using a functional approach
- Utilize Redux for state management
- Handle user interactions via event handlers
- Perform arithmetic operations and update state accordingly

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```git
   git clone https://github.com/pritesh-git/calsi_redux.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
